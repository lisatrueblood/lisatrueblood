<img src="images/aboutme.jpeg" alt="Picture of Lisa" style="width:50%;height:50%;">

I am comfortable at the intersection of finance, technology, and creativity. I leverage my unique blend of experiences to orchestrate large-scale product launches and go-to-market efforts, while never losing sight of the business objective: driving revenue.

I have spent more than a decade working in the Los Angeles tech industry. As a marketing director and product owner in the consumer products, education technology, and telecommunications industry, my skill set can be applied to any industry.

My methods are backed in design thinking. Empathizing with the customer comes naturally to me. I develop personas, map user journeys, prototype, and test my assumptions. I analyze data and talk to customers to understand their pain points and turn this information into actionable insights.

Having worked cross-functionally with Engineering, UX, Creative, and Product on many projects, I am skilled at turning business objectives into technical requirements, and excel at facilitating communication between technical and non-technical teams. I am currently pursuing my MBA from UCLA Anderson and have a degree in International Business.
